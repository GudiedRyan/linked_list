# linked_list
Practice building basic data structures using OOP

In main.py, you will find the singly linked list. This contains all the basic methods for a singly linked list. The test file for this structure is test.py.

In doubly_linked_list.py you will find the doubly linked list. The test file for this one is double_test.py.

The available methods for the doubly linked list are:
1. Add a new head
2. Add to the end of the list
3. Search the list for a node
4. Delete a node
5. Insert a node after another specified node. If that node turns out to be the tail, it will add it to the tail. Similar rule applies to the head.

To run the tests, first make sure you're in the pipenv (pipenv shell in the terminal) then just type pytest (appropriate test file).
